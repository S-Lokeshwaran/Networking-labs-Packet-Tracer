# 🌐 Cisco Packet Tracer Networking Labs

Welcome to my **first networking repository** — built completely from scratch using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
This repo is the starting point of my journey to master **Routing, Switching, and Network Fundamentals** through practical hands-on labs.

## 🎯 Objective

To learn and apply real-world networking concepts by:
- Designing topologies manually (no prebuilt `.pkt` files)
- Practicing **Subnetting**, **Routing (OSPF & Static)**, and **DHCP**
- Understanding how each router, switch, and device connects and communicates
- Building confidence to troubleshoot and configure using CLI commands
